   <td width="748">5. This week’s programming task will cover concepts required by Assignment 2. You should aim to get the help of your tutors and make further revisions.<strong>Coding exercise steps (Hint: Need help? Ask your tutor via Canvas→Discussions→”IIE07″):</strong>Complete the 11/Jan/2021 solution first as this extends upon that work. Next follow Canvas→<a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/modules">Modules→Week 7</a> where the topics of creating non-static methods is explained. <strong>Your tutors will provide further explanations on these general topics and how they relate to this IIE during their weekly “tutor chats”</strong>. Please also follow the announcement ‘<a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/discussion_topics/1039805">How to debug large programs and get help on</a> <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/discussion_topics/1039805">debugging…</a>’a)                   In this week’s IIE, modify <u>your own adaptation</u> of the IIE06 student manager (which has to be different to the student manager) so that it has a console-based interface as well as a GTerm-based user interface within the same program (all within one class for now).The constructor must now take an int parameter named userInterfaceMode which when assigned an argument of:0:  Allows the same functionality (adding and displaying of records) from IIE06 to be performed exclusively via the console (usingScanner for inputs and System.out for outputs)1: Allows the same functionality (adding and displaying of records) from IIE06 to be performed exclusively via the GTerm. You can reuse most of the GTerm code from your adaptation of IIE06.b)                   Refactor/re-organise your code so that:1.                   All GTerm-based method and object member variable names start with the prefix “gui”2.                   All console-based method and object member variable names start with the prefix “console”3.                   Whichever code that is somewhat common to both GTerm and console approaches must be put in to common methods and object member variables. These must not have “gui” or “console” in their names. You will likely need to some create methods that accept parameters and ones that return values (sometimes both).Tip: In IIE08, we will refactor the GUI/GTerm to one class, the console-code to another class and have the common code in yet another class to be used by the first two classes. As IIE07 is the last step before multi-class programs, it is expected it will be harder to maintain (which is what will be addressed by multi-classes in IIE08+).<strong>An important note about Assignment 2: </strong>In Assignment 2, there must be only one interface (GTerm). It is expected that students realise that there would be a better way to implement the ability to switch between different types of user interfaces and the concepts relevant to</td>
